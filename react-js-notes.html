        <h4>Do I need a Complex Setup / Workflow?</h4>
        <div>First of all, one can drop import for React via Node.js, and good to go</div>
        <div>Set-up should also flow to what type/size of project/app is being created.
            <div class="inner-div">
                <p>For example, just import react.js and react-dom js</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>You can also go create-react-app route; which is like a CLI for React</p>
                <p>Feature-rich Workflow with Zero Setup (100% Customizable)</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Or you build your own Custom workflow</p>
                <p>There you can Tailor your own Workflow / Workflow Integration</p>
                <h3>For bigger and single-page application, it is recommended to use create-react-app</h3>
                <h4>provides optimized workflow and project set-up that is still being worked on/that React app is actively maintaining
                , therefore provides many optimizations</h4>
